    # to capture part of the URL and send it as a keyword argument to the view.
    # The angle brackets may include a converter specification 
    # (like the int part of <int:section>) which limits the characters matched and may also change
    # the type of the variable passed to the view. 
    # EX: <int:section> matches a string of decimal digits and converts the value to an int.
 
    # The view argument is a view function or the result of as_view() for class-based views.
    # It can also be an django.urls.include().
